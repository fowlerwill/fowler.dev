# Let's just get something out.

I'm committed to trying to maintain a blog, and that requires writing. It's
a lot, but it's not - I was going to write some thing about the juxtaposition
I find myself in, surrounded, spoiled with oppulence, but also searching for
a product to sell Canadians that they're going to love, find value in, and
ultimately transform the healthcare economy in Canada for the betterment of
patients and the system health overall.

Today's blog is a little difficult for me to find the words that I'm comfortable
expressing in this (lol) public fashion. I want to have profound things to 
say, but they come across to me as trite, and petty, and I'd prefer to give
the world real insight, truth, beauty, horror, and most of all humour, but
I guess they can't all be winners. Try, try again another time.
